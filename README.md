# Number Guessing Game

## Concept
This is a fun Android game, in which you earn points by guessing the greater of two numbers. But beware, you'll lose points for incorrect guesses!

## Technicals
* At the core of this app is a the Java Random Number Generator
* This is one of my first Android apps, so I wanted to use the basics: TextViews, Buttons, and RelativeLayout
* To make things a little more fun, I've customized the UI to make it more visually appealing
* And added Toast notifications to help the player along!
